# national parks search

## User Story

Parks Search was an application written for the outdoor
enthusiast to be able to find national parks in an area of interest and find information, such as a picture, information
and directions to get there and current weather condtions at that location in order to plan a trip accordingly.
This application solves the problem of being able to find and explore new state parks and
make it easy for a user to find unique information that they would need
Given I am a user on National Park Search.
When I search for a national park or area.
Then I am presented with parks based on that location.
When I view the parks.
Then I am presented with the name of the park, image, url, addresses, directions to get there, the current weather at the park, and links more information at the park
When I return to the home page after searching for parks.
Then when I start to search again, my past search areas appear as selection options.

## Project description

Park Search is an application that allows users to search for national parks near them or in an area they are visiting. They will be able to find information about the park including:
information about the park,
current Weather conditions at the park.
Operation info and links to further information.
The motivation for creating this application was to find a new way to help users find unique information to help them in planning trips and making informed decisions based upon local weather conditions.
Park search was built with API's from nps.gov and openweathermap.org and dynamically
created unique content on the page to display the users requested results. We learned how to work together as a team to utilize multiple api's usising javascript, css, html and extensive use of FontAwesome to create a unique and responsive search engine that would accomodate a large market of users. We learned as a team how to work together to create a concept for a project, plan the approach for the build, delegate the tasks, fix bugs and finally generate a finished working product.
